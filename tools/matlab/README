This file briefly describes the setup procedure necessary for installing the EPICncVis package.
 These home grown Matlab scripts are tools for visualizing extract files produced by the 
 EPIC model.  Please direct all inquiries and bug reports to Aaron Herrnstein (aherrnst@gmail.com).
                         


                                       Installation

1.) Edit the script INSTALL_EPICncVis and set the EPIC_..._PATH variables.  For experienced Matlab
     users, set EPIC_MATLAB_USER_PATH to the directory where Matlab work is conducted.

2.) At the command line, type INSTALL_EPICncVis to extract the file EPICncVis_<version>.tar.gz and 
     setup the Matlab environment for using EPICncVis.  

3.) Make sure EPIC_MATLAB_USER_PATH/startup.m contains the "CUT" section of 
     EPIC_MATLAB_SRC_PATH/README_STARTUP_M.

4.) Create an alias in your .cshrc (or analogous rc file for your shell) so that Matlab is
     always started from EPIC_MATLAB_USER_PATH (e.g., alias matlab 'cd EPIC_MATLAB_USER_PATH; /bin/matlab').
    
5.) No other installation should be required.  See the README files in
     EPIC_MATLAB_SRC_PATH/matlab_extras/ if errors occur that point to problems in mexnc or netcdf_toolbox.



                                         Contents

The contents of the EPIC_MATLAB_SRC_PATH/ directory are listed below.  More information is obtained 
   about each m-file by entering the command "help <m-filename>" from within Matlab.

   EXAMPLES/                    -  Directory of example m-files for first time users.  These
                                   files should be copied to EPIC_MATLAB_USER_PATH, and then
                                   modified to meet the needs of the user.

   EPICncVis/                   -  The core Matlab scripts used to extract and process EPIC
                                   data.  Alter the scripts in this directory WITH CAUTION!

   EPICncVis/PlotEpicDatFile.m  -  Matlab script for plotting .dat files generated by EPIC.

   EPICncVis/PlotEpicNC.m       -  Matlab script for plotting variables in netcdf extract files 
                                   generated by EPIC.

   EPICncVisTools/              -  A repository of Matlab scripts used to extract and process EPIC
                                   data.  The contents of this directory should NOT be altered.

   matlab_extras/               -  Extra matlab libraries required to extract and process EPIC data.
                                   The contents of this directory should NOT be altered.
