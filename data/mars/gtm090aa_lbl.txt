DESCRIPTION                  = "
 
 This file contains coefficients and related data for a spherical 
 harmonic model of the shape of Mars.  Input data are from the Mars
 Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
 spacecraft.  Coordinate system is IAU 1991 (Davies et al., 
 Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy, 53, 377-397, 1992),
 areocentric, with longitudes measured positive east.  When 
 evaluated, the model gives absolute radius from Mars center of
 mass in meters.
 
 The model is a numerical transform of planetary radius values
 from the MOLA 0.5-degree gridded data set        
            DATA_SET_ID = 'MGS-M-MOLA-5-IEGDR-L3-V2.0'
            PRODUCT_ID  = 'MOLA-IEG0062R.IMG'
 into spherical harmonics using Simpson's Rule quadrature.
 
 The gridded data set included all MOLA nadir observations from the
 Orbit Insertion phase, plus Mapping Phase nadir observations from
 the beginning of mapping through the end of December 1999. 
 Additionally, off-nadir observations of the north pole were
 included from 87 N latitude and northward, taken during the spring
 of 1998, and of both poles taken in July of 1999, from 87 N and S 
 to the poles.  Orbits 355 and 358 of the Orbit Insertion Phase 
 and parts of orbits 10709 through 10716, inclusive, of the Mapping
 Phase were excluded because solutions for these orbits were deemed
 to be poor. (Note: subtract 10000 from a MOLA mapping phase orbit 
 number to determine the equivalent MGS Project orbit number.) 
 Also excluded were shots more than 1 degree off-nadir except as 
 noted above), channel 4 returns, and any returns not classified 
 as ground returns, e.g. clouds or noise, according to the
 SHOT_CLASSIFICATION_CODE. A total of approximately 123 million
 observations are represented.
 
 Further improvements to the model are expected as additional MGS 
 data are incorporated.                       
 
 This product is a set of two ASCII tables: a header table and a 
 coefficients table.  Definitions of the tables follow.
