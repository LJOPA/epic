 Name 
   epic, mpi_epic - run the EPIC model 

 Syntax
   epic [ options ] infile 

 Description 
   Reads infile (netCDF format) and integrates 
   the primitive equations forward. 

   Options are listed below. 

 Tips
   Put $EPIC4_PATH/bin in your path. 

   Create a subdirectory (folder) for each type of experiment,
   outside of the $EPIC4_PATH directory tree, and run the model
   from that subdirectory. The files unique to your run will then
   be separated from other runs, which will help with managing 
   different projects, and you will be able to archive or recompile the model
   without affecting runs.

   To stop a run at the next scheduled save or backup, type 
     %touch epic_stop
   in the run directory. Don't forget to type
     %rm epic_stop
   before restarting.

 Options 

   -help or -h           Write this message. 

   -itback n             Specifies n timesteps between writing backup 
                         files (epic.nc format). The previous backup is 
                         renamed epic_back2.nc and the current one is 
                         named epic_back1.nc. They are written to the same 
                         directory containing infile. The two are leapfrogged 
                         to insure always having a good backup should a 
                         write to disk fail. If -itextract is set but -itback
                         is not, then -itback will default to the same interval
                         as -itextract.
 
   -itrun n              Specifies how many timesteps to run the model.
   
   -itsave n             Specifies n timesteps between writing full save 
                         files (epic.nc format). These are labeled by the 
                         model time and written to the same directory 
                         containing infile. If not specified, the default
                         is to save the last timestep of the run. 

  -itextract n           Specifies n timesteps between writing selected
                         variables to a file. The variables are 
                         marked for extraction beforehand via the programs 
                         initial or change. Tendency data are not written.   
                         All data are appended to the single file extract.nc.


  -append extract.nc     Specifies that extracts should be appended to an
                         existing file of the given name, rather than starting
                         a new extract file.
              

 Example 
   To integrate the file epic.nc forward 10000 timesteps,
   saving twice and extracting every 100, with runtime messages 
   to be written to the file ``epic.log'', type: 

   %epic -itrun 10000 -itsave 5000 -itextract 100 epic.nc >& epic.log &
