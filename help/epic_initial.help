 Name 
   initial - create initial epic.nc (netCDF format) file 

 Syntax
   initial [ options ]  

 Description 
   Creates a netCDF format input file for the EPIC model.
   The user picks a planet and configures its atmosphere by 
   responding to prompts. 

 Tips
    Create a subdirectory (folder) for each type of experiment,
    outside of the $EPIC4_PATH directory tree, and run the model
    from that subdirectory. The files unique to your run will then
    be separated from other runs, which will help with managing 
    different projects.

    You may wish to put your equivalent of ~/epic/bin in your path.

Troubleshooting
    The model uses linear interpolation on the data values in the
    table epic/data/(planet)/t_vs_p.(planet) when setting up the
    hybrid coordinate.  If you encounter a glitch in the initial
    values of THETA near p_sigma, adding more points to the 
    t_vs_p file by interpolation, especially in the vicinity of
    p_sigma, may clear up the problem.

 Options 

   -help or -h   Write this message. 

 Examples
   These examples assume you have your version of ~/epic/bin
   in your path, such that the executable 'initial' can be
   invoked from any directory.


   To create the file epic.nc for an experiment called run01: 
   %cd
   %mkdir run01
   %cd run01
   %initial 

   Next is an example of the contents of a 'layers.dat' file for 
   use with initial's 'from file option for setting up the model
   layer intervals. The pressures correspond to the layer
   interfaces; the K=0 value is ptop.
