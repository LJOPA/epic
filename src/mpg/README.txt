The mpg library provides functions for domain decomposition of 
gridded models.

To turn on debugging, edit the file $EPIC4_PATH/include/qa.h
and uncomment the debug() macro. Set the QA_DEBUG environment
variable in your .cshrc file (or equivalent) as described.

The mpg library was written by Joe Matarese in the late 1990s, 
in his capacity as a system supporter for the MIT Earth Resources 
Laboratory's nCUBE 2. Matarese is no longer supporting the
mpg code, but the good news is the code has held up over time.

The original mpg code calls one function from the MPICH
MPE library, MPE_Decomp1d(). To allow the MPG library to compile
on implementations of MPI other than MPICH, the source code for 
MPE_Decomp1d() is included here with permission as mpich_decomp.c.

The Fortran interface source code has been separated into
a subdirectory because it caused problems that are
described in ./fortran_interface/README.txt. The original
C interface code is  preserved in the subdirectory ./c_original.
